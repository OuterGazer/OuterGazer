# My recent experience

I'm a former civil engineer switched to game designer/developer in 2020. This is what I have accomplished the last year:

- Designed and developed 19 small games from a breadth of genres ranging from text adventure to FPS, including 2D, 3D and C# Windows command-line games.
- Followed over 6 lengthy online courses ranging from developing, to math, to game design.
- Read (and re-read) over 6 books on game design and development including books such as “Game Design Workshop” from Tracy Fullerton, “Designing Games” from Tynan Sylvester and “Unity in Action” from Joseph Hocking. Weekly read and/or watch articles/videos on game design topics. More books are pending to be read.

For further information on my work/experience you can refer to my LinkedIn profile (link on the sidebar) or my pinned projects below.
